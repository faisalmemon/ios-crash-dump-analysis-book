I'd like to acknowledge the help and support of my colleagues for writing this book.  

I am indebted to the support of my Chinese-language translator, XiaWenqiang, for helping bring the Chinese edition of the book into fruition.

Putting together this work was only possible because it was built upon generously provided open source tools, in particular `pandoc` which made writing the text of the book a pleasure.

Lastly, I'd like to thank my supportive family whilst I was locked in my study, and largely absent.  Thank you Junghyun, and Christopher.
